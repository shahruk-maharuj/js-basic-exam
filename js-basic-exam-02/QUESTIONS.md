# Online Shopping Cart Program

Welcome to the development phase of our online store's shopping cart system. Below are the requirements and features we'd like to see:

## Features:

### 1. Store Introduction:

- Greet the user upon entering the online store.

### 2. Product Display:

- Showcase the following products and their prices:
  - **T-shirt**: $10
  - **Jeans**: $30
  - **Hat**: $5
  - **Shoes**: $50

### 3. Shopping Experience:

- Prompt the user to select an item to add to their cart or to view their current cart.
- Allow continuous shopping: let the user add as many items as they desire.

### 4. Cart Management:

- Display the total cost of the items in the cart.
- Offer options to either proceed to checkout or continue shopping.
- If an item not on the list is added, inform the user of its unavailability.
- Facilitate the removal of items from the cart if the user changes their mind.

### 5. Checkout:

- If the user decides to checkout, present a thank you message along with the total amount due.

## Development Constraints:

- Utilize arrays to manage the items in the cart and their associated prices.
- Implement loops (e.g., `while`, `for`) to enhance the shopping experience.
- Properly integrate the `break` and `continue` keywords where they can optimize the flow.
- Employ `if...else` constructs to guide user decisions and handle various scenarios.
- Ensure accurate and dynamic updating of the total cost as items are added or removed from the cart.
